  I left the world of theatre and acting to pursue a career in web development at General Assembly. The knowledge and lessons I learnt at General Assembly has left me filled with excitement for whatever opportunity may come next.

  <h3>Core Skills</h3>
  <p class="bio"><strong>Management</strong> = Directing productions in the professional theatre demands skills across many disciplines, as ultimate responsibility for the artistic staging and commercial success of a production rests with me. The ability to coordinate multiple activities within a tight timeframe and under strong financial constraints is essential in delivering profitable productions has been consistently demonstrated in my career to date.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="bio"><strong>Teamwork </strong>= Advanced levels of teamwork are critical to all successful theatrical productions and software development, where I have successfully (and often simultaneously) managed to be supportive, challenging, active, and cooperative as the dynamics of the group have demanded.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p class="bio"><strong>Motivation</strong> = I have found it easy to be strongly motivated in pursuit of my goals, and have been willing to sacrifice much to achieve success. Equally, I have been clear-sighted enough to recognise when tough decisions have to be taken. It took a lot of motivation and courage to change careers from acting to web development, but I could not be happier.
